This project detects and segments damaged parts in vehicle images.

## âœ¨ Key Features
- **High-Performance Model**: Achieves accurate segmentation by combining the DeepLabV3+ architecture with a powerful EfficientNet backbone.
- **Configuration-Driven Experiments**: Easily manage iterative experiments by changing hyperparameters and model options in a `train_config.yaml` file.
- **Folder-Based Inference**: Provides a convenient inference feature that processes not only single images but also entire folders at once.
- **Stable Logging**: Reliably records and manages the training process using `Loguru`.


## ðŸ“‚ folder structure
The overall folder structure is as follows:

```

â”œâ”€â”€ configs/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ train_config.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ dataset/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dataset.py
â”œâ”€â”€ experiments/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ run.py

## ðŸ”§ Setup and Installation

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clary97/Car_Damage_Segmentation.git
cd Car_Damage_Segmentation
```

#### 2. Download the Dataset

This project uses the **[Car Damage Dataset (CarDD)](https://cardd-ustc.github.io/)**. Please download the dataset from the link below and extract it so that the `CarDD_release` folder is located in the project's root/dataset directory.

* **Download Link**: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bbyqVCKZX5Ur5Zg-uKj0jD0maWAVeOLx/view

The final folder structure should look like this:
```
Car_Damage_Segmentation/
â”œâ”€â”€ dataset/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ CarDD_release/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ CarDD_COCO
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ CarDD_SOD
â”œâ”€â”€ configs/
â”œâ”€â”€ experiments/
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

#### 3. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to create a virtual environment to keep project dependencies isolated.

```bash
conda create -n (your env name) python=3.8
conda activate (your env name)
```

#### 4. Install Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, run the following command to install all the required libraries.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸš€ Usage

### Training

All settings are managed in the `configs/train_config.yaml` file. To start an experiment, run the following command:

```bash
python experiments/run.py
```
As training progresses, a new timestamped folder will be created in the `outputs` directory, containing the trained model (`best_model.pth`), log files, and a final results summary (`summary_results.csv`).

### Inference

Open the `predict.sh` file, modify the paths for the image folder and model weights, and then run the following command:

```bash
sh predict.sh
```
Once execution is complete, the visualized result images with damage areas highlighted will be saved in the output folder specified in the `predict.sh` file.
